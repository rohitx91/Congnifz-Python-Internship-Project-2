# Congnifz-Python-Internship-Project-2
Level 1 Task 2: Temperature Conversion program for Cognifyz Python Internship.

📧 Project Title
Temperature Converter using Python

🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a simple Python program that converts temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
It helps strengthen foundational programming skills, user input handling, and mathematical operations in Python.

📝 Problem Statement
Can we develop a Python program that takes a temperature value and its unit (C or F) and accurately converts it to the opposite temperature scale?

🎯 Objectives
1) Accept numerical temperature input from the user
2) Ask the user for the temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit)
3) Convert and display the result in the alternate unit
4) Strengthen understanding of functions, conditions, and arithmetic formulas

📂 Example Input / Output
Example 1
Input:
Temperature: 37
Unit: C
Output:
37.0°C is equal to 98.60°F

Example 2
Input:
Temperature: 98.6
Unit: F
Output:
98.6°F is equal to 37.00°C

⚙️ Requirements
 1) Python 3.x
 2) Any code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.)

🧠 Implementation Steps
1) Take a temperature value input from the user
2) Ask the user whether the value is in Celsius or Fahrenheit
3) Apply one of these formulas based on the unit:

    C → F: (C × 9/5) + 32
    F → C: (F − 32) × 5/9
4) Print the converted temperature
5) Handle invalid unit inputs
